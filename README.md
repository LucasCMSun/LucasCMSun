Hi! I'm LucasCMSun, just a random person in this planet.
I'm just a normal user (at least for now) since I can't do any programming work AT ALL basically.
(I can only do a little bit of Visual Basic and a tiny bit of C++.)
I'm only 13 y/o so I can't really concentrate on programming things.
So I'm here just for fun.
